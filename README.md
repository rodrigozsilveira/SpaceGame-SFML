I plan on writing a brief documentation for the code in the future. Feel free to contact me, but there's nothing really special. 

I also plan on updating it from time to time, right now my thoughts are:
point and score system/menu
increase in difficulty with time, just like those endless running games
adding SFX to all the stuff
adding animations to events in the game, like death or game starting
maybe improving the already existing animations

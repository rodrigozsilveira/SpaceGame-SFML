## This project is a simple 2D space shooter made with SFML. 
 
I plan on updating it from time to time. My thoughts are:

-  Point and score system with a menu
-  Increase in difficulty over time (like endless runner games)
-  Add sound effects (SFX) for actions/events
-  Add animations to key events (e.g., death, game start)
-  Improve existing animations
